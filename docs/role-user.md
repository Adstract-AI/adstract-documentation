description: Definition and intended usage for the Adstract User role.
---

The `User` role is a neutral/default account role.

## What it means

A User is someone who has created an Adstract account but has not yet committed
to a business role.

## Typical use

- Explore the platform.
- Review product experience before selecting a specialized role.
- Prepare for a later upgrade to Publisher (or Advertiser when available).

## Limitations

User role is not the primary role for API key onboarding. For SDK/API key
access, use the `Publisher` role.
